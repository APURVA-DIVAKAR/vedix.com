        <h2>What’s Unique About Vedix?</h2>
        <p>Vedix is India’s first customised Ayurvedic haircare brand made from 100% natural ingredients. This is a haircare brand that is made in India celebrating the rich knowledge and heritage of Ayurveda.</p>
        <p>Generic products vs Vedix customised Ayurveda</p>
        <p>hair type differs from person to person and so do the hair concerns. These generic products may not work or sometimes work but also show side effects too. More often than not, these products end up causing more damage than good.</p>
        <p>Vedix products are 100% natural, Ayurvedic and exclusively customised for every individual hair type based on a thorough understanding of your hair type, texture, and your lifestyle and not just your hair issue. Interestingly, Vedix uses a targeted approach to deal with specific hair concerns and is highly effective in providing long term results without any chemicals involved.</p>

        <p>How do Vedix formulations work on the hair?</p>
        <p>Vedix used natural plant-based ingredients which are safe and easily absorbed by the hair for better results. What makes Vedix unique is that the products act beyond the surface of the hair. The key factor is to balance the elevated Dosha levels by using herbs and natural formulations.</p>
        <p>The three product combination of Vedix Customised Ayurvedic hair Care Regimen protects your hair from everyday damage; the cleanser is gentle on the hair and gets rid of the oil and dirt, the moisturiser nourishes the hair preventing the drying of the hair and the serum helps improve overall hair health.</p>

                <h3>Vedix- A Wise Investment For Beautiful hair</h3>
                <p>Isn’t your face the first thing that people notice? It is exactly the reason why your haircare regime should be a priority.</p>
                <p>Dirt, pollution, UV rays, stress, lifestyle etc. take a huge toll on your hair and sometimes the damage caused is very hard to reverse.</p>
                <p>Fact: The use of unsuitable hair care products can cause 3X damage in a very short time! There are so many products that claim to help reverse this damage. However, these products are:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Made with harmful chemicals</li>
                    <li>Not safe for the long run</li>
                    <li>Very expensive</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Using expensive and fancy premium products is not the solution. The ideal haircare solution is one that is highly effective in treating hair concerns, protect the hair from damage and at the same time affordable.</p>
                <p>Most of these products are nowhere close to being as safe as Vedix and are very expensive, costing Rs.1500/- per product. A 3-product regimen may cost a whopping Rs.5000/-.</p>
                <p>However, Vedix provides safe and effective products that are exclusively formulated for your hair at a very affordable price. The customised 3 product haircare package costs as low as just Rs.999/-</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Free from alcohol, oil, silicons, sulfates, parabens or preservatives!</li>
                    <li>100% Ayurvedic & customised for you!</li>
                    <li>Among the safest hair care products in India!</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Your customised ayurvedic products also come with a 30-day money-back guarantee. You can claim a full refund within 30 days if you are not satisfied with your products!</p>
