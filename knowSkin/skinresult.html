        <h2>What’s Unique About Vedix?</h2>
        <p>Vedix is India’s first customised Ayurvedic skincare brand made from 100% natural ingredients. This is a skincare brand that is made in India celebrating the rich knowledge and heritage of Ayurveda.</p>
        <p>Generic products vs Vedix customised Ayurveda</p>
        <p>Skin type differs from person to person and so do the skin concerns. These generic products may not work or sometimes work but also show side effects too. More often than not, these products end up causing more damage than good.</p>
        <p>Vedix products are 100% natural, Ayurvedic and exclusively customised for every individual skin type based on a thorough understanding of your skin type, texture, and your lifestyle and not just your skin issue. Interestingly, Vedix uses a targeted approach to deal with specific skin concerns and is highly effective in providing long term results without any chemicals involved.</p>

        <p>How do Vedix formulations work on the skin?</p>
        <p>Vedix used natural plant-based ingredients which are safe and easily absorbed by the skin for better results. What makes Vedix unique is that the products act beyond the surface of the skin. The key factor is to balance the elevated Dosha levels by using herbs and natural formulations.</p>
        <p>The three product combination of Vedix Customised Ayurvedic Skin Care Regimen protects your skin from everyday damage; the cleanser is gentle on the skin and gets rid of the oil and dirt, the moisturiser nourishes the skin preventing the drying of the skin and the serum helps improve overall skin health.</p>

                <h3>Vedix- A Wise Investment For Beautiful Skin</h3>
                <p>Isn’t your face the first thing that people notice? It is exactly the reason why your skincare regime should be a priority.</p>
                <p>Dirt, pollution, UV rays, stress, lifestyle etc. take a huge toll on your skin and sometimes the damage caused is very hard to reverse.</p>
                <p>Fact: The use of unsuitable skin care products can cause 3X damage in a very short time! There are so many products that claim to help reverse this damage. However, these products are:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Made with harmful chemicals</li>
                    <li>Not safe for the long run</li>
                    <li>Very expensive</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Using expensive and fancy premium products is not the solution. The ideal skincare solution is one that is highly effective in treating skin concerns, protect the skin from damage and at the same time affordable.</p>
                <p>Most of these products are nowhere close to being as safe as Vedix and are very expensive, costing Rs.1500/- per product. A 3-product regimen may cost a whopping Rs.5000/-.</p>
                <p>However, Vedix provides safe and effective products that are exclusively formulated for your skin at a very affordable price. The customised 3 product skincare package costs as low as just Rs.999/-</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Free from alcohol, oil, silicons, sulfates, parabens or preservatives!</li>
                    <li>100% Ayurvedic & customised for you!</li>
                    <li>Among the safest skin care products in India!</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Your customised ayurvedic products also come with a 30-day money-back guarantee. You can claim a full refund within 30 days if you are not satisfied with your products!</p>
